          <h2 class="animated fadeInDown mb-2">History</h2>
          <p class="animated fadeInDown">The history of measurement systems is a fascinating journey, with numerous
            contributors, but John Wilkins
            and Gabriel Mouton played significant roles in its development. While the title of "father of measurement"
            might be subjective, it's important to acknowledge their contributions to this field.</p>

          <p class="animated slideInRight">John Wilkins, an English clergyman, was a polymath and linguist who made
            notable strides in the realm of
            measurement. In 1668, two years before Gabriel Mouton's contributions, Wilkins penned a work that laid the
            groundwork for modern measurement systems. He introduced concepts like a universal measure based on a
            decimal system, aiming to create a standardized and rational approach to measurements. Although his ideas
            didn't gain immediate traction, they were instrumental in shaping subsequent discussions on measurement
            standards.</p>

          <p class="animated slideInLeft">Gabriel Mouton, on the other hand, is often considered the founding father of the
            metric system. In 1670,
            Mouton proposed a decimal system of measurement known as the "Mouton system." This system included units
            based on powers of ten, which is a fundamental principle of the modern metric system. Mouton's ideas marked
            a crucial milestone in the development of standardized measurements.</p>

          <p class="animated slideInRight">French scientists recognized the value of Mouton's proposal and spent years
            refining and implementing it.
            The result was the development of the metric system as we know it today. The metric system has since become
            the international standard for measurements in science, industry, and everyday life, providing a coherent
            and easily understandable system of measurement based on the decimal system.</p>

          <p class="animated fadeInUp">In summary, John Wilkins and Gabriel Mouton both made substantial contributions
            to the evolution of
            measurement systems. Wilkins laid the groundwork for rationalizing measurements, and Mouton's proposal
            marked a pivotal moment in the establishment of the metric system, which has since become the cornerstone of
            modern scientific and industrial measurements.</p>

          <h4>SI Unit System</h4>
          <p>The SI unit system is the modern form of the metric system and is comprised of seven base units that use
            twenty metric prefixes to denote decimal multiples or submultiples of the base unit.It is a system that was
            stringently conceived and is defined based on invariant constants of nature including the speed of light,
            the triple point of water, and a physical prototype.</p>

          <h4>Metric Unit System</h4>
          <p>The metric system is a system of measurement that uses the meter, liter and gram as base units of
            length(distance), capacity(volume) and weight(mass) respectively. To measure smaller or larger quantities,
            we use units derived from the metric units.To convert bigger unit to smaller unit we multiply by 10and to
            convert smaller unit to bigger unit we divide by 10.</p>

          <h4>Traditional U.S Units</h4>
          <p>US customary units are a system of measurements used in the US.UCS originated from English units which were
            used by the British Empire starting as early as 1495 and continued to be used in the UK up until replacement
            by the imperial system in 1824. While US uses the SI unit system in many other areas including science,
            medicine, industry,etc</p>
